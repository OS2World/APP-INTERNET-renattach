Jem Berkes [ www.sysdesign.ca ] is the original and primary author of
renattach. Version 1.2.0 is a complete rewrite with all-original code.

Many people around the world have helped test and improve this filter.  
In particular, I would like to thank the following people for their
contributions to this project:

Stefan A. Deutscher <sad@mailaps.org> has helped improve renattach so it 
builds smoothly on a wider variety of platforms (including OS/2). He has 
also contributed FreeBSD and other ports.

Richard Gadsden, at the Medical University of South Carolina, has
suggested and debugged many software improvements over the years. He has
also tested renattach on a major mail server and provided valuable
feedback about bugs.

Hal Murray <hmurray@suespammers.org> contributed a collection of real
email viruses and worms that helped verify the filter's effectiveness.

Colin McKinnon suggested several features and contributed code to the
1.1.x series. The improved renaming technique and procmail-compatible 
filtering he suggested were built into version 1.2.0.
