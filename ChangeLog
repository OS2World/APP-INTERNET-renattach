WARNING:
	THIS SOFTWARE HAS BEEN DISCONTINUED. IT IS NO LONGER MAINTAINED.

1.2.4 changes
=============
- New --loop option removes Delivered-To headers from the input message
  This defends Postfix against a "mail forwarding loop" spam relay trick

1.2.3 changes
=============
- Fixed a MIME parser bug where some headers were incorrectly sanitized
  (Thanks to Adam Harper <aharper@fullers-group.com> for providing the patch)
- Added support for '#' to suppress new_extension, submitted by bhoc@pentagroup.ch
- Fixed build scripts to handle getopt properly. Now builds cleanly on FreeBSD

1.2.2 changes
==============
- [SECURITY] The --pipe now directly executes command/args, instead of popen()
  NOTE new --pipe syntax, do not specify quotes around command and its args!
  (Thanks to Victor.Duchovni@MorganStanley.com for illustrating the problem)
- Added preprocessor directives to help with OS/2, win32, other builds
  (Thanks to sad@mailaps.org for help tweaking the build)
- Relaxed RFC 2047 decoder to support more clients (e.g. The Bat)
  (Thanks to IL <lookin@oltamar.ru> for reporting the problem)
- Fixed base64 decoding bug affecting non-English file names
- Added htmlwarn_pos option to specify insertion position for warning_html
- Added warning_text, warning_html options to add warnings to message body
- Fixed compile error on signal()

1.2.1 changes
=============
- [SECURITY] Shell characters are now stripped when using --pipe
- Now keeps headers inserted by previous renattach passes, using Old- prefix
- Added full_rename option to allow selection of full or partial rename scheme
- Added pass_contentid option to pass MIME Content-ID through filter (risky)
- Enhanced badlist format to include specific actions for matches inside ZIP
- Added search_zip option to enable file name searching inside ZIP archives
- Added kill_exe option to kill executable binary attachments (like delete_exe)
- Now supports Outlook-style multiline encoded filenames

1.2.0 changes
=============
- Changed --excode (extra exitcode) to more sensible value
- Added new .conf options to allow specific subjects for ban, exe delete, etc.
- Added default add_subject to inform user of filtering (use # to disable)

1.2.0rc3 changes
================
- Created man page for version 1.2.0
- Tested and documented sendmail compatibility (local delivery agent)
- Enhanced badlist format; specific actions can override default action

1.2.0rc2 changes
================
- If message Subject is to be modified but doesn't exist, Subject: is added
- Removed default add_subject, otherwise there is no way to disable feature
- Enhanced banned_files format to allow substring matches (prepend '/')
- Relaxed MIME parser to allow whitespace between MIME_NAME and equals sign
- Added more leeway to executable binary scan (used by delete_exe feature)
- The .conf file parser can now deal with CRLF (DOS format) text files
- Tested and documented postfix compatibility (master.cf / content_filter)
- Added --pipe option to send output to a command instead of stdout
- Improved behaviour of --excode and --version options
- Added --settings option to view configuration

1.2.0rc1 changes
================
- COMPLETE rewrite of software. Now much more structured, flexible
- Now uses autoconf/automake and getopt for more standard behaviour
- All new command line options and .conf file format

1.1.1 changes
=============
- Added a FAQ
- Modified scripts to be more Solaris-friendly
- The MIME content-type is renamed whenever a file is renamed
- Uses generic filename if encoded filename is found (remove in defs.h)
- Now uses syslog. Enabled by default (remove in defs.h)
- More checks for buffer overflows in make_safe()
- Confirmed that it works fine with postfix and qmail
- The -v switch now shows version string
- Improved efficiency by strncmp'ing before sscanf'ing

1.1.0 changes
=============
- Added scripts! configure, make, install, uninstall
- Wrote a manpage
- Converted code to 100% pure C
- Upper limit placed on growing-dynamic-buffer algorithm
- Reads good and bad extensions lists from .conf file
- Partial mode renamed to badlist mode
- Default bad list made much more complete (see renattach.conf)

1.02 changes
